      <hr class="my-4">
      <p>One of my projects in my UI/UX bootcamp was aimed at redesigning a local nonprofit website to help them get even better at doing what they do. My group and I searched for one that we were all passionate about and ended up choosing a cat rescue shelter named Love Me True Rescue. This nonprofit is dedicated to rescuing, rehabilitating, and finding forever homes for felines in need in the Ponte Vedra Beach, FL area. We were not able to get a response after reaching out to them, but we chose to move forward with the design challenge either way.</p>

      <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
      <p>One of the most important aspects of a nonprofit organization‚Äôs platform is its ability to invoke emotion that engages their audience and effectively leads to action. Love Me True Rescue‚Äôs website lacks basic structure and its current design style is not the most engaging or persuasive. </p>

      <li class="list-group-item">Objective: To understand the difficulties and discomforts users familiar with NPOs face when interacting with their platforms in order to begin to understand how to encourage greater community investment and outreach.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">Plan: Conduct 5 user interviews with candidates that are interested in animal adoption and/or have experience with nonprofit animal shelter organizations. Semi-structured interview that includes at least 10 open-ended and probing questions. Affinity diagram to identify insights.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">We asked questions about:
        their recent experiences with a nonprofit organization‚Äôs website, 
        their donation habits,
        their adopting decisions and what influences them,
        and their specific grievances related to online adoption.</li>
